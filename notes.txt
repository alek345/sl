NODE_NEGATION should probably be NODE_UNARY.

A NODE_BASIC_RETURN should probably return a null value. This
should also be the same for the end of function return. This
way you can safely assign the return value of a function
even though it doesnt return anything. The best would probably
to give a warning or something at compile time. Altough that
requires some good or atleast developed semantics.

Make sure some_table["some_other_table"]["value"] = 5; Works

Also look into adding a "dot" syntax:

some_table["some_other_table"]["value"] = 5; turns into:
some_table.some_other_table.value = 5;
