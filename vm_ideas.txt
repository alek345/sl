Stack based VM

Only two registers. PC ans SP

There is 'x' amount of global variable space provided by the vm.
So if you have to store an int(2) and the string "Hello, world!" in
global varible memory it would look like this:

byte global_mem[sizeof(int)+strlen("Hello, world!")+1];
The content would look like this:
00 00 00 02 'H' 'e' 'l' 'l' 'o' ',' ' ' 'w' 'o' 'r' 'l' 'd' '!' 00

To index this we would need a table that keeps tab of where each entry
starts. For this example the table would look something like

+-------+--------+
| ENTRY | OFFSET |
|   0   |   0    |
|   1   |   4    |
+-------+--------+

The vm will have several abstract opcodes. But I am going to
try to keep the instruction set RISC like. However there will probably be
some multiple byte opcodes.

Each opcode should be 1 byte. They can then be followed by neccesaray
information. Like constants or global variable entries.


Instruction set
========================

bb = 1 byte information
bbbb = 2 byte information
bbbbbbbb = 4 byte information

ICONST bbbbbbbb
FCONST bbbbbbbb
